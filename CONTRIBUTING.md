# Contribution Guide
## General Contribution Guidelines

- If you're making a change to the UI, please include "Before" and "After" screenshots as a GitHub comment in your pull request. Mobile and desktop should both be included if the change affects both views.

- Your PR should have a description, where you explain what the change is and why it should be accepted. This can be anything from a single line to several paragraphs as needed. For major changes, it's recommended to open an issue first, so it can be discussed and vetted. If your PR fixes an existing issue, please reference it in the description of the PR (by using #<issue-number> e.g. #30).

- Your PR title should be a summary of this description.

Here's an example of a good PR: https://github.com/shalvah/oldtweets.today/pull/11
